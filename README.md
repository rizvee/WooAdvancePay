# WooAdvancePay
WooAdvancePay is a WordPress plugin that allows you to implement partial payment for WooCommerce, with the ability to charge a delivery fee in advance. This advanced payment option can be enabled or disabled based on customer locality, giving you control over who needs to pay the delivery charge upfront.
